CrossViewJS
===========

Building
---------

The simpliest way to build CrossViewJS is:

    $ make js

If you want to generate the minified version and run automated tests, just do `make`.
But, in this case, there are dependencies to python and selenium.


### Automated Tests

To run automated tests, just do `make test`, but you need to have python e selenium module installed.

To install dependencies, do:

    $ sudo apt-get install python python-setuptools
    $ sudo easy_install selenium
